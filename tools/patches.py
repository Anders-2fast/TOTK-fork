"""Per-instruction replacements applied by gen.py (guest address -> function(gen, addr) returning C code).

Each entry replaces the one instruction at that address of `main` (canonical address, 0x7000000000 + offset) with the C
the function returns; gen.py rebases the addresses in it for --dyn-base. Check the instruction word first (an assert),
so a wrong build fails here instead of patching the wrong code. Example, from LAS Recomp's widescreen: a camera's
`ldr sN, [xM, #imm]` of the 16:9 aspect literal, replaced by a call into the runtime:

    def _aspect_load(gen, a):
        w = struct.unpack_from('<I', gen.nso.image, a - gen.base)[0]
        assert (w & 0xffc00000) == 0xbd400000, hex(w)  # ldr s, [x, #imm]
        rt = w & 31
        return (f'{{ extern float rt_aspect_site(int); float f = rt_aspect_site(0); '
                f'c->v[{rt}] = 0; memcpy(&c->v[{rt}], &f, 4); }}  /* {a:#x}: ldr s{rt}, =16/9 */')

BOTWRecompAndroid's patches (its frame pacing, widescreen and a reload crash, at BOTW's addresses) are in this file's
git history and docs/botw/BOTW-PORT.md.

Tears of the Kingdom 1.4.3's sites come from MacNativeGames (github.com/ly05010419/MacNativeGames,
games/totk/runtime/game_patches_v143.c), which runs the same build on Macs and checks each original instruction the
same way: its addresses and words matched this build's main one for one.
