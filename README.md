# TOTKRecompAndroid

**English** | [Português](README.pt-BR.md)

A static recompilation of *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* (Nintendo Switch, version **1.4.3**) for
Android, in its first steps. This is **not emulation**: the game's ARM64 code becomes C compiled for your phone, and its
graphics (NVN) are translated to Vulkan.

It is built on the engine of **[LAS Recomp](https://github.com/peiikai/LASRecomp)** by peiikai (a recompilation of
*Link's Awakening*), its Android port **[LASRecompAndroid](https://github.com/mamcjr/LASRecompAndroid)** and
**[BOTWRecompAndroid](https://github.com/mamcjr/BOTWRecompAndroid)**, which this repository was forked from.

> [!WARNING]
> **Early.** On the phone (with the Turnip driver) the game loads a save in the prologue's cave and Link can be moved,
> at about 30 fps; little beyond that has been played. The plan and the state of each phase are in
> [docs/TOTK-PORT.md](docs/TOTK-PORT.md) (in Portuguese).

## Supported platform

Android only (arm64, Vulkan). Windows, Linux or macOS may be used as development hosts with the Android SDK/NDK.

## Status

- The app (start screen, settings, touch controls, controllers, mods, Vulkan driver choice) comes from
  BOTWRecompAndroid and builds.
- 1.4.3 runs on Nintendo SDK 20.5.22, the line of BOTW 1.8.2's 20.5.6 (NVN 55): what the engine learned from BOTW 1.8.2
  applies. The game's patches and much of what is known about it come from
  [MacNativeGames](https://github.com/ly05010419/MacNativeGames), which runs this very build natively on Macs and iPhones.
- The game's code generates and builds: 228,238 functions from `main` and 40,516 from the SDK, in a 224 MB
  `totkgame.so`.
- On the phone (POCO F7 Ultra, the Turnip driver): the title screen, then a save loaded in the prologue's cave with
  Link under control and the HUD and hints in Portuguese, at about 30 fps walking around (Turnip). The scene is held at 1600x896 (the game's
  dynamic resolution gave black frames at each step) and the world steps by real time. Character voices, music and
  ambience reach the mix (Opus decoding and the audio renderer's splitters; checked by recording the output on 1.4.2,
  the port's previous version). With Qualcomm's own driver it plays too, at about 15 fps.
- Not done yet: movies (not checked), widescreen, 60 fps, performance beyond the cave.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Like LAS Recomp, this project is made almost entirely with AI (Claude, by Anthropic, through Claude Code), directed,
> tested and reviewed by a human.

> [!NOTE]
> **No game files are included.** You need your own legally obtained dump of *Tears of the Kingdom* with the 1.4.3
> update applied (`exefs` and the `romfs`). Instructions on how to obtain it will not be provided.

## Building (developers)

With the Android SDK / NDK and your dump in `Dump/0100F2C0115B6000/` (`exefs/` and `romfs/`, or the RomFS image
`romfs.bin`; the folder is ignored by git), with Python and the `lz4`, `capstone` and `unicorn` packages
(`tools/nsp_extract.py` unpacks NSPs and their title keys for hactoolnet):

```bash
cd tools && python totk_dump.py                              # check the dump (modules, version, romfs)
cd android/totkrecompandroid && ./gradlew assembleDebug      # the app
android/build_gamelib.sh Dump/0100F2C0115B6000/exefs         # the game code (~20 min on a PC)
ROMFS_HOST=1 android/push_game.sh Dump/0100F2C0115B6000      # game files and game code onto the phone
android/run_boot.sh 120                                      # start the game, log to android/out/boot.log
```
