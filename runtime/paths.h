// Where TOTKRecompAndroid keeps its files (runtime/paths.c).
//
// Data root: everything the app writes or the user brings - extracted/ (game files), save/,
// cache/ (shaders / pipelines), fonts/ (imported), larecomp.ini. rt_paths_init() picks it and makes it the
// working directory, so the rest of the runtime opens those by their relative names. In order:
//   1. LARECOMP_DATA_ROOT (tests, scratch installs)
//   2. dev / portable mode: the starting directory already has extracted/ (a source checkout: `./build/totkrecompandroid
//      extracted`, the test scripts) - used as is
//   3. macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/com.mamcjr.totkrecompandroid (the .app bundle itself is never written to)
//      Windows: the folder of the .exe (portable, no installer); refuses to start, with a message, if not writable
//      Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/totkrecompandroid (~/.local/share/totkrecompandroid)
//      Android: the app's external files folder (Android/data/<package>/files)
//
// Game versions: that root is the main version's (rt.h GAME_V_MAIN, Tears of the Kingdom 1.4.3). Others would each run in a folder
// of their own inside it, v<version> (game files, saves, settings - android/run_ver.sh's test runs use the same ones):
// the one the start screen chose (game_version.txt in the root) becomes the data root instead, its settings and saves
// starting as copies of the main version's (services/fs.c, LARECOMP_SAVE_SEED). There are none yet (paths.c
// other_version), but the mechanism stays from BOTWRecompAndroid (1.0.0, 1.6.0 and 1.8.2 side by side).
//
// Resources: files that ship with the app (helper programs, the window icon) - next to the executable (the
// Windows folder, the .app's Contents/MacOS), in the .app's Contents/Resources, or in the source tree.
